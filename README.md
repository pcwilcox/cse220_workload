# CSE220 Workload

This repo is for CSE220 Computer Architecture at U.C. Santa Cruz taught by Prof. Scott Beamer. 

## Dependencies:
  * ESESC is set up to run in `/home/cse220/build/release`
  * I'm pretty sure you'll need working networking on the VM to download the data set

## Usage:
```
git clone https://github.com/pcwilcox/cse220_workload.git ~/cse220_workload # clone this repo
/home/cse220_workload/install.sh                                            # clone the workload repo
/home/cse220_workload/test.sh                                               # execute the workload
```
